### Coding Standards

We follow **WordPress Coding Standards**. Please ensure your code:

#### PHP Standards
- Use WordPress coding style
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading for classes
- Include proper PHPDoc comments
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors gracefully

```php
/**
 * Example of good PHP documentation
 *
 * @param int    $form_id The MetForm form ID
 * @param array  $response The form submission data
 * @return bool  True on success, false on failure
 */
public function handle_form_submission($form_id, $response) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Security Standards
- **Always sanitize inputs** using WordPress functions
- **Validate data** before processing
- **Use nonces** for admin forms
- **Check capabilities** for admin actions
- **Escape outputs** when displaying data

```php
// Good examples
$webhook_url = esc_url_raw($_POST['webhook_url']);
$secret = sanitize_text_field($_POST['secret']);
wp_verify_nonce($_POST['_wpnonce'], 'metform_n8n_settings');
```

#### Database Standards
- Use WordPress database prefix
- Prepare queries with `$wpdb->prepare()`
- Create proper indexes
- Include rollback procedures

```php
// Good example
$wpdb->query($wpdb->prepare(
    "INSERT INTO {$wpdb->prefix}metform_n8n_queue (form_id, payload) VALUES (%d, %s)",
    $form_id,
    $payload
));
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples
git commit -m "Add retry logic for failed webhooks"
git commit -m "Fix SSL certificate validation issue"
git commit -m "Update admin interface styling"

# Avoid
git commit -m "Fix bug"
git commit -m "Update stuff"
git commit -m "Changes"
```
